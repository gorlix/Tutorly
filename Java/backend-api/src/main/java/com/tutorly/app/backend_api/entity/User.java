/**
 * JPA Entity representing an authenticated account in the tutoring system.
 *
 * <p>A User is any account that can log in: a tutor who conducts lessons and
 * administers tests, a STAFF member with elevated management privileges, or a
 * GUEST who only has read access to their assigned student(s) (e.g. a parent
 * or guardian). The role field determines which of these the account is.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key Features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Authentication: unique username and password for system access</li>
 *   <li>Status management: tracks active, inactive, on-leave states</li>
 *   <li>Role classification: GENERIC, STAFF, GUEST</li>
 *   <li>Creation tracking: links to admins who created the account</li>
 *   <li>Activity management: lessons, tests, prenotations, and calendar notes</li>
 *   <li>Dual prenotation roles: as assigned tutor and as creator</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Common Use Cases:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Creating tutor/staff/guest accounts by administrators</li>
 *   <li>Managing tutor assignments to lessons and students</li>
 *   <li>Tracking tutor availability through calendar notes</li>
 *   <li>Recording lessons conducted and tests administered</li>
 *   <li>Creating and managing student bookings (prenotations)</li>
 *   <li>Letting a GUEST account view the student(s) linked to it (see {@link Student#getUser()})</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Usage Example:
 * <pre>
 * User user = new User(
 *     "mario.rossi",
 *     "hashedPassword123",  // Should be hashed in production
 *     "ACTIVE",
 *     "STAFF"
 * );
 * userRepository.save(user);
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Database Mapping:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Table: app_user (named to avoid the reserved SQL keyword "user")</li>
 *   <li>Primary Key: id (auto-generated)</li>
 *   <li>Unique Constraints: username must be unique</li>
 *   <li>Collections: lessons, tests, prenotations, calendar notes (one-to-many/many-to-many)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
