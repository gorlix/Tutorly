/**
 * JPA Entity representing a Student in the tutoring system.
 * 
 * <p>Students are the primary recipients of tutoring services. Each student can be enrolled
 * in lessons, have prenotations (bookings), and take tests. Students are tracked with personal
 * information, class assignments, and status indicators for active enrollment management.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Key Features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Personal information: name, surname, and description</li>
 *   <li>Class assignment: tracks student's grade or class level</li>
 *   <li>Status tracking: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, SUSPENDED, etc.</li>
 *   <li>Relationship management: one-to-many with lessons, prenotations, and tests</li>
 *   <li>JSON optimization: uses @JsonIgnoreProperties to exclude collections on serialization</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>Common Use Cases:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Enrolling new students in the tutoring program</li>
 *   <li>Scheduling lessons and creating bookings for students</li>
 *   <li>Tracking student progress through tests and attendance</li>
 *   <li>Managing active vs inactive student status</li>
 *   <li>Querying student history (lessons attended, tests taken)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>Usage Example:
 * <pre>
 * Student student = new Student(
 *     "Marco",
 *     "Rossi",
 *     "3A",
 *     "Excellent in mathematics, needs help with physics",
 *     "ACTIVE"
 * );
 * studentRepository.save(student);
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>Database Mapping:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Table: student</li>
 *   <li>Primary Key: id (auto-generated)</li>
 *   <li>Collections: prenotations, lessons, tests (one-to-many with cascade)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>JSON Serialization:
 * The @JsonIgnoreProperties annotation prevents the collections (lessons, prenotations, tests)
 * from being serialized to JSON by default, avoiding circular references and large payloads.
 * The allowGetters = true setting allows these collections to be included if explicitly requested.
 * </p>

 * @see Prenotation
